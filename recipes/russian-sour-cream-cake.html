    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cake</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
      <li>Combine eggs and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer for 5 minutes until mixture is smooth and thick. Sift 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour on top and carefully mix into the batter using a wooden spoon or a spatula. Pour batter into the prepared springform pan.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and allow to completely cool on a wire rack, about 1 hour.</li>

      <li>Cut cake horizontally into 3 layers. Place bottom layer on a cake platter and spread with a layer of cream filling. Add second layer and spread another layer of filling on top.
